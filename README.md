RNA Sequence Representation Learning
With the continuous advancement of high-throughput sequencing technology, the abundance of biological sequence data containing vital life-related information has substantially increased. These sequences have become indispensable tools for disease detection, mechanistic analysis, and drug discovery, with their significance notably highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrently, recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have ignited substantial interest in representation learning across diverse domains.

Efforts are underway to enhance downstream performance while mitigating training costs. To comprehensively comprehend biological sequence data, representation learning has emerged as a pivotal approach for embedding and extracting features from extensive collections of biological sequences.
